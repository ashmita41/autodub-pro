## Features and Capabilities

### Which video formats does AutoDub Pro support?
AutoDub Pro supports most common video formats including MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, and WebM. For best results, we recommend using MP4 (H.264) videos.

### How many languages can AutoDub Pro handle?

- **Standard tier**: Videos up to 30 minutes
- **Professional tier**: Videos up to 2 hours
- **Enterprise tier**: Unlimited video length

### Can AutoDub Pro generate subtitles?

### Does it preserve the original background music and sound effects?
Yes, AutoDub Pro intelligently separates speech from background audio, allowing you to maintain the original music, sound effects, and ambient sounds while replacing only the spoken dialogue.

## API and Integration

### Which AI services does AutoDub Pro use?
AutoDub Pro integrates with multiple AI providers including OpenAI, Google Cloud, Azure Cognitive Services, and Amazon AWS for various aspects of the dubbing process. You can configure which services to use in the settings.

### Do I need my own API keys?
While AutoDub Pro provides built-in API access for basic features, for best results and higher usage limits, we recommend using your own API keys from supported providers. This gives you more control over costs and quality.

### Can I integrate AutoDub Pro with my existing workflow?
Yes, professional and enterprise tiers support CLI (Command Line Interface) operation, batch processing, and watch folder functionality for integration with existing video production workflows.

## Quality and Accuracy

### How natural do the dubbed voices sound?
The voice quality depends on the selected TTS (Text-to-Speech) engine and voice model. Premium voices from providers like ElevenLabs and PlayHT offer near-human quality, while standard voices are good for most casual applications.

### How accurate are the translations?
Translation accuracy depends on content complexity and language pairs. For straightforward content between widely-spoken languages (e.g., English to Spanish), accuracy is typically very good. For specialized content or rare languages, some manual review and editing may be beneficial.

### Can I customize pronunciations for specific terms?
Yes, AutoDub Pro includes a custom pronunciation dictionary where you can specify how particular words, names, or technical terms should be pronounced in each target language.

## Workflow and Usage

### What's the typical workflow for dubbing a video?
1. Import your video
2. Generate or import subtitles
3. Review and edit subtitles if needed
4. Select target language(s)
5. Choose voice(s) for dubbing
6. Adjust translation if necessary
7. Generate the dubbed audio
8. Preview and make adjustments
9. Export the final video

### Can I edit the translated text before generating speech?
Yes, AutoDub Pro allows you to review and edit the machine-generated translations before creating the dubbed audio. This is particularly useful for technical terminology or culturally-specific content.

### How long does the dubbing process take?
Processing time depends on video length, selected quality, and your internet connection. As a rough estimate:
- A 5-minute video typically takes 3-8 minutes for complete processing
- A 30-minute video may take 15-40 minutes
- Longer videos are processed in parallel segments for efficiency
